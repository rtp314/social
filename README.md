# Social

This is an experiment in setting up a simple social media website using Firestore.

It's not trying to be pretty, I'm just playing around with the functionality of user authentication and real-time databases in Firebase.

Dependencies: React, Firebase, React Router

Store list of friends for each user
When starting a chat, create a new database collection for that 'chatroom' (unique ID, or concat the two uids)
Client returns latest 100 messages from that collection


Goals:
1. Set up users and friends, friend lists
2. Friend list in chat
3. Create chatrooms
4. retrieve messages, create cursor
